# Progress log

Rule (CLAUDE.md, added 2026-11-09): after every finished step, append date,
step, commit hash, proving tests/evidence, and the exact next step. A new
session must be able to resume from this file and `git log`.

## 2026-11-09 — security-review fixes F1–F8 (Part 1 of the fix mandate)

| Step | Commit | Proven by |
|---|---|---|
| F1 complete_delete symlink refusal + server-generated storage names | `a7d3201` | `tests/security/test_destructive_paths.py` green (acceptance: symlink test); suite 200 passed / 5 failed (remaining = F2–F6 acceptance) |
| F2 delete-during-send → clean 502 (delete wins; both orders tested) | `41b96f4` | `tests/security/test_chat_concurrency.py` 20/20 green incl. new second-order test; suite 202/4 |
| F3 422 on NUL/control/reserved/overlong filenames + titles | `92c9a69` | `tests/security/test_input_validation.py` + NUL acceptance green; suite 208/3 |
| F4 legacy chat/ingest log exception CLASS only | `c11fd53` | `test_legacy_chat_exception_text_must_not_reach_logs` green; suite 210/1 |
| F5 Tavily error class+status only | `ee1701c` | `test_tavily_error_text_must_be_reduced_to_class` green; suite 210/1 |
| F6 content-based upload type check | `45e1aac` | `tests/security/test_upload_pipeline.py` 8/8 green; **full suite 215 passed / 0 failed** |
| F7 verify-script guards (b2 ckc empty-guard, b4 tautology) | `3dc3a6b` | `bash -n` clean; live re-runs below |
| F8 review tests promoted to permanent `tests/security/` | `d4d0324` | suite 215/0 from new paths; route-inventory negative test now permanent |
| SAST: Bandit + Semgrep in CI (fail high only) | `1d12574` | bandit `--severity-level high` exit 0 (zero findings at ANY severity after deleting dead `PASSWORD_ROUTE`); semgrep `p/default --severity ERROR --error` exit 0 (2 JUSTIFIED suppressions in legacy audit writer); suite 215/0 |
| Fixes evidence (raw live records) | `8201cc5` | `docs/review/fixes-evidence.md`: **b2.sh 72 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 SKIP** (the previously-skipped legacy-chat REAL call ran and passed), **b3.sh 53/0/0**, **b4.sh 26/0/0** (Pinecone test namespace; legacy namespace untouched) |

All pushed to `origin/backend/multi-user` through `8201cc5`.

## 2026-11-09 — Part 2: department/group design amendment (docs only)

- Commit: (this commit) — `docs/backend-design.md` gains §A14 (audiences
  org/group/private with `group:<id>`/`user:<id>` tokens, `group_editor`
  role, AccessResolver interface, M1–M3 Alembic plan from `0004_documents`,
  share flow with D11 preserved, quotas, permission matrix, 10
  backend-agnostic behavior tests, code-impact table, abuse cases, 10
  DECISIONS FOR FARHAD); D4/D6/D10/D11 rows amended; D6 web-fallback
  default flips to `false` (decided).

## EXACT NEXT STEP

**STOP — do not start B5 or B6.** Await Farhad's answers on §A14.11
(DECISIONS #1–#10, especially #1 admin-sees-filenames and #2 share
semantics). After decisions land: implement the groups phase per §A14 as
new steps, each with tests first, PROGRESS.md updated per the CLAUDE.md
rule. Standing reminders: B5 (audit writer, legacy chat stops writing
content, guarded `query_audit` drop) and B6 (admin endpoints) come after,
per §A12 order; review finding #4 (parser size bound + timeout) must land
WITH personal uploads (§A14.10).
